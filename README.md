# README

**mensa_app** is a basic javascript/web application for [Socialunch](https://github.com/chfin/mensa_server) server.

## Purpose and limitations

This webapp is a rough prototype and is intended to be a client for the `mensa_server`. The final version should run on most modern browsers on desktop and mobile devices. At the moment, we recommend using Firefox or Chrome on Android or any desktop OS.

Due to the fact that this is a rough prototype, real secure login via OAuth or similar protocol is not available yet. 


## Resources

The app is based on the [EnyoJS](http://enyojs.com) Framework which already powers the apps on the HP Touchpad. 

The Icons are from the [Gentleface Wireframe mono iconset](http://gentleface.com/free_icon_set.html).
